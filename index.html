                <div class = 'about'>
                    <p>I am a UK based Web Developer, with over 25 years of amateur experience, finally taking the leap into the professional arena.</p>
                    <p>I've been playing with code since I learnt to type, and building websites since my Dad installed our first modem.</p>
                    <p>After over 15 years in the Live Events industry I've decided to move into Web Development full-time.</p>

                            <p>I began building websites before CSS was really a thing. Over the years I've sought to constantly improve upon my knowledge of both HTML and CSS, and have built websites for friends, colleagues and myself.</p>
