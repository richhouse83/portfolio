        <about class = 'about'>
            <p>I am a UK based web developer, with over 25 years of amateur experience, finally taking the leap into the professional arena</p>
            <p>I've been playing with code since I learnt to type, and building websites since my Dad installed our first modem,</p>
            <p>After over 15 years in the Live Events industry I've decided to move into Web Development full-time.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I have knowledge and experience of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>HTML and CSS</h4>
                    <p>I began building websites before CSS was really a thing. Over the years I've sought to constantly improve upon my knowledge of both HTML and CSS, and have built websites for friends, colleagues and myself.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>JavaScript, including React, Vue.js, HandleBars and Bootstrap</h4>
                    <p>I am about to begin the NorthCoders Web Development Pathway, and have spent the last year building a firm knowledge of JS fundementals.</p>
